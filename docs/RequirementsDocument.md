# Stories and personas
Mike is a young business owner and he has a great civic sense that lead him to create a platform to help people saving money. The software collects prices of fuels in different stations and provides them to people in order to get gas as cheaper as possible relating with their position. When people need to refuel, they consult the platform to find the nearest station with the lowest price.Mike manages all users reports concerning errors related with gas station position and gas price and he has to handle users. He also has to verify the truthness of gas station owners that want to use his platform to get advertisement, checking their p.iva using the agenzia delle entrate website.

Nathan has a gas station outside a city, near an orbital road and want to be more known by the citizen of the near city. His prices are lower than the competitors and the location is quite strategic, but right now the citizens prefer to go to internal gas station, even if more expensive. Nathan would like to have a way to better advertise his prices.

Joel has a gas station in a highway: prices are quite high due to location, but his services are the best: there are a picnic area, a restaurant, restrooms with showers, a bar, a minimarket and a car wash service. He would like to better advertise his offer, in order to have more customers.

John loves to travel the country riding his truster motorbike. In doing so, he often finds himself with an almost empty tank, and no knowledge of the nearby gas stations. He wants an application on his phone mounted on the bike able to guide him to the nearest gas station. He also wants to compare the different prices and choose the cheapest, since traveling is an expensive hobby per se. Accessing to this platform, he would like to save some favourite gas stations and leave comments or reports of price errors.

Frank is the head master of Vodafone Italia, and he travels around Italy every day. He doesnâ€™t take care of prices because Vodafone covers every costs. So he uses the app to find the nearest station or the one with more services and he is not interested on sharing information with the community.

# Use case diagram and use cases


## Use case diagram
\<define here UML Use case diagram UCD summarizing all use cases, and their relationships>


\<next describe here each use case in the UCD>
### Use case 1, UC1
| Actors Involved        |  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the UC can start> |  
|  Post condition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after UC is finished> |
|  Nominal Scenario     | \<Textual description of actions executed by the UC> |
|  Variants     | \<other executions, ex in case of errors> |

##### Scenario 1.1 

\<describe here scenarios instances of UC1>

\<a scenario is a sequence of steps that corresponds to a particular execution of one use case>

\<a scenario is a more formal description of a story>

\<only relevant scenarios should be described>

| Scenario 1.1 | |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the scenario can start> |
|  Post condition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after scenario is finished> |

\<concepts are used consistently all over the document, ex in use cases, requirements etc>

# System Design
\<describe here system design>

\<must be consistent with Context diagram>
