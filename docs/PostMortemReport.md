Consider the EZGas project and provide your thoughts after completing it. 
Distinguish between what you could not change (requirements, tools, timing, team selection, etc) 
and what was under your control (team organization, available skills, communication tools, etc).
Also this document will not be used for evaluations, but for improving the project approach for the coming year.


# Best things

- Realize a project from scratch
- Implement the waterfall approach in a real context
- Teamwork organization to meet the deadlines
- Team creation (we were lucky)

# Worst things

- Framework not explained before the project
- Communication tools not used properly to convey the necessary assistance
- Documents required for a deadline uploaded few days before it

# Suggestions 

- Have introductory lessons to tools used
- Upload documents in advance (10-14 days before deadline)
